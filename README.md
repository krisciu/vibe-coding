## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

This project uses Supabase for data storage. You need to set up the required table manually in your Supabase dashboard:

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to the SQL Editor
4. Run the following SQL:

```sql
-- Create the vibes table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.vibes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  twitter_handle TEXT NOT NULL,
  vibe_data JSONB NOT NULL,
  likes INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create index on twitter_handle for faster lookups
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_vibes_twitter_handle ON public.vibes(twitter_handle);
```

5. Update your `.env.local` file with your Supabase URL and anon key:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## üì± Deployment

This project is designed to be easily deployable to Vercel with minimal configuration. Simply connect your GitHub repository to Vercel and deploy!

## üß† Future Enhancements

In future iterations, we plan to:
- Integrate with the Twitter/X API to generate vibes based on actual tweet content
- Add more vibe categories and aesthetic options
- Create a gallery of popular vibes
- Allow users to customize specific elements of their vibe

## üé® Vibe Coding Project

This project was created as a "vibe coding" experiment - focusing on creating something fun, chaotic, and shareable in a short amount of time. It's meant to be lighthearted and entertaining rather than solving a serious problem.
